It's the most crucial factor for improving developer experience and should be the first thing to implement if not already in place.

## Why?

- Allows entering "flow state", where you can concentrate deeply on complex tasks
- Reduces context switching (can take 23 mins to refocus after interruption)
- Enhances problem-solving
- Improves code quality, less errors

## How?

- "No Meeting" blocks or days
- Async communication
- Clear problem statement (reduces context switching, prevents scope creep, greater engagement)

## Challenges

- Balancing with collaboration needs
- Avoiding constant availability
- Coordinating in distributed teams

## Other Benefits

- Improved job satisfaction
- Reduced burnout
- Better talent retention
- Improved quality of software
