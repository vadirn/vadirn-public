Everyone knows that a good pull request has several key characteristics, such as:

- Small, focused changes
- Clear title and description
- Contextual information (such as related issues or discussions)

But what really makes it **awesome** is "Accompanying gif" section.

![]({style})

Here is slightly reduced PR template we used to use at Plan:

<div class="code">

```txt
## 🌱 What does this PR do?

1. ...

## 📚 Storybook changes

1. ...

## 👆 Clickables

- ...

## 👏 Accompanying gif


```

</div>

Even if every other aspect of PR is terrible, just try adding a gif to it ✨
